# The Guided Rose Kata

This is a jruby version of the Guild Rose kata, found [here](http://craftsmanship.drupalgardens.com/content/gilded-rose-kata).
The aim is to demonstrate a way of testing java classes using rspec.

This is a legacy code kata, so the focus is on safely refactoring the already
implemented code. The original kata had no tests, however since (for me at
least) the real learning is in the refactoring so there will be a test suite
provided.
